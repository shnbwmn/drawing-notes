# Learning how to draw

First step: *start drawing*. Keep your early sketches to monitor your progress.

### The basics

* **Draw directly from life.** Handle the pencil loosely, and press sensitively.
* **Draw often.** So often that it becomes a habit.
* **Draw in spare moments.** Sitting on a bus, waiting for a friend, on a lunch break, etc. Don’t wait for a specific time or place. Use whatever opportunity is available.
* **Don’t bother with photo-realism.** Sketch form, structure, tone - get to the gist of the subject. Add finish later.
* **Draw intensely.** Focus. Imperfect observation is the bane of drawing.
* **Draw with a purpose.** Communicate the subject clearly using the fundamentals: line, shape, texture, tone, composition, etc.
* **Explore mediums, surfaces and techniques.** Rub charcoal around to create subtle shadows; cross-hatch with a pen; block-in areas of tone with wash; use white on mid-tone paper to enhance highlights; use grainy paper to create texture, etc.

### Additionally

* **Scrutinise the work of artists past and present.** Don’t limit yourself to one art-type/field - each has something unique to offer.
* **Attend drawing classes.** Especially those for figure drawing.
* **Befriend fellow/future artists.** There are tips and tricks you can glean from watching them work, and in casual conversation with them.
* **Ask questions of the world around you:** why does this object look like this; what effect will this lighting condition have on this scene, etc. Let your curiosity roam wild.
* **Educate yourself on art principles and theory.** Gestalt, the [right-side of the brain](http://drawright.com/), [perspective](https://issuu.com/beshlaa/docs/perspective_drawing_handbook), contour, gesture, anatomy, the fundamentals previously mentioned, etc. Try to get physical books as far as possible. The more concepts you can understand and apply, the better. Van Gogh [wrote](http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/11/184.htm?qp=art.support) of how easily he could draw a room after he learnt perspective.
* **Set-up drawing experiments.** Place a few basic shapes against a white background, and shine different light sources on them with varying angles, positions and intensities. Or draw the same subject in multiple styles.
* Try to get hold of a **full-body anatomical skeleton** and/or **small wooden mannequins** of the figure and hands. Statue casts are particularly interesting, because they were [diligently copied](https://vk.com/doc174101046_174324478?hash=63520daf6ba1f0959b&dl=76664a0100b40bd8e5) at the art academies of previous centuries. It is still good practice, as well as copying master drawings.

Draftsmanship is valuable for any type of art you want to do, be it painting, illustration, anime, comics, designs, commissions, etc. Repetitious, verbatim drawing from photos does little to teach you originality, spontaneity or prowess - necessary to express, beautify and exaggerate.
