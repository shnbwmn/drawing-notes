Leave photography to cameras - they do that pretty well.\r\n\r\nGood drawing is when you can **construct**, for instance, a person’s face from any angle, with whatever lighting,\r\nand to whatever finish. It also means using some **artistic licence** to create something beyond a mere copy - a\r\n*gestalt*. This requires that you learn things beyond basic observing as well - perspective, anatomy, tone,\r\ncomposition, etc. Look at Old Master drawings, or any other good drawings - you’ll see nothing flat or\r\nphotorealistic about them. They have life and solidness, even when they’re quick sketches. At any point\r\nin time the artist can take that sketch and “work it up” into a highly finished piece of work.\r\n\r\nDrawing what you see is a good way to start learning to draw. However the artist’s way of seeing helps you\r\nonly to see - it doesn’t make you an Artist. You need to be able to go further by feeding on drawing/art\r\ntheory, studying the work of other artists and manipulating the art fundamentals to really express and\r\ncreate in your drawings. Approach it like a science, trying desperately to **understand**.\r\n\r\nSome of the example drawings below are old - don’t worry about that. Look at the **skill** of drawing. Again,\r\nthere’s nothing photorealistic about them. They **modelled** the human and other forms. Some are quite “dirty.”\r\nThey might not even be what the respective artists saw, because they carefully organised the visual\r\ninformation to suit their artistic intention. Notice the vast difference compared to the flat, lifeless\r\ncopy drawings one sees on sites like DeviantArt. I’ll admire a quick and dirty but lively sketch over a\r\ncarefully “shaded” photorealistic eye drawing any day.\r\n\r\n**_[Bridgeman](http://www.artgraphica.net/free-art-lessons/constructive-anatomy-george-bridgman/constructive-anatomy-george-bridgman-art-book.html)_**\r\n\r\n![](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5b922dbd3c13075bd188801c9b6e40e6-c?convert_to_webp=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n**_Rembrandt_**\r\n\r\n![](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-174ece8166a2c0b43ea2ad712982a350-c?convert_to_webp=true)\r\n\r\n![](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2353c933f647e0fbddfe83615d2674c6-c?convert_to_webp=true)\r\n\r\n**_Ingres_**\r\n\r\n![](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ce951349ee9853e24485ad9c3adb49ed-c?convert_to_webp=true)\r\n\r\n**_[Loomis](http://saveloomis.org/)_**\r\n\r\n![](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-15ef8fb6d4a9f0c92a304d36d19e39a2-c?convert_to_webp=true)\r\n\r\n**_Schiele_**\r\n\r\n![](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9f7c4a2995681d706a6b50437d592243-c?convert_to_webp=true)\r\n\r\n**_Van Gogh_**\r\n\r\n![Van Gogh](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4e2a1f78693fa948c19782435d1b20ae-c?convert_to_webp=true)\r\n\r\n*Originally posted to [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Will-I-get-better-at-drawing-if-I-consistently-keep-drawing-what-is-in-front-of-me/answer/Shane-Bowman).*\r\n\r\n*< Previous: [Learning how to draw](https://github.com/shnbwmn/drawing-thoughts/blob/master/learning-to-draw.md) | [Index](https://github.com/shnbwmn/drawing-thoughts/blob/master/README.md)*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
