# Getting Better At Drawing

Getting better depends on many factors:

* how *observant* you are
* what *instructional material* you ingest
* if you’re objective enough to know you’re *not “there” yet* (ever)
* if you’re receiving *objective feedback* from another artist
* if you’re *drawing from life*, etc.

Let’s be clear on one thing: the point is **not** to create a photorealistic drawing, as so many people try
to do by copying photos. Leave photography to cameras - they do that pretty well.

Good drawing is when you can **construct**, for instance, a person’s face from any angle, with whatever lighting,
and to whatever finish. It also means using some **artistic licence** to create something beyond a mere copy - a
*gestalt*. This requires that you learn things beyond basic observing as well - perspective, anatomy, tone,
composition, etc. Look at Old Master drawings, or any other good drawings - you’ll see nothing flat or
photorealistic about them. They have life and solidness, even when they’re quick sketches. At any point
in time the artist can take that sketch and “work it up” into a highly finished piece of work.

Drawing what you see is a good way to start learning to draw. However the artist’s way of seeing helps you
only to see - it doesn’t make you an Artist. You need to be able to go further by feeding on drawing/art
theory, studying the work of other artists and manipulating the art fundamentals to really express and
create in your drawings. Approach it like a science, trying desperately to **understand**.

Some of the example drawings below are old - don’t worry about that. Look at the **skill** of drawing. Again,
there’s nothing photorealistic about them. They **modelled** the human and other forms. Some are quite “dirty.”
They might not even be what the respective artists saw, because they carefully organised the visual
information to suit their artistic intention. Notice the vast difference compared to the flat, lifeless
copy drawings one sees on sites like DeviantArt. I’ll admire a quick and dirty but lively sketch over a
carefully “shaded” photorealistic eye drawing any day.
